Abdullah ibn Mas’ud reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said,
 “Most of the sins of the children of Adamn are on their tongues.” 
 Ibn Mas’ud said, “O tongue! Speak goodness and be rewarded, or remain silent and be safe,
 lest you become regretful.”
The rose is red
 A girl is playing there 
There is a playground
an aeroplane is in the sky
Numbers are not allowed in the password.”
